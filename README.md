# Trend Generation and User Engagement: The Challenge of Trend Discovery for Gen Z

## Problem Statement

Fashion trends evolve rapidly, and traditional methods for trend forecasting often fall short in addressing the fast-changing interests of Gen Z, a demographic known for its diverse fashion sense. The challenge is to effectively identify and predict trends that resonate with this dynamic audience.

## Why Current Methods Fall Short

- **Slow Trend Analysis**: Traditional methods are often lagging behind real-time trends.
- **Lack of Real-Time Engagement**: Limited user interaction and participation.
- **Limited User Participation**: Current platforms do not engage users actively in the trend discovery process.

## Solution

Our app addresses these challenges by creating an interactive platform where Gen Z users can participate in fashion challenges and discover trends based on real-time user interactions.

- **User Interactions**: Other users can like and comment on submissions, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.
- **Trend Analysis**: Winners are determined based on the number of likes and comments, as well as the uniqueness of the submission, identified through feature extraction techniques.
